# Web-Scraper-for-News-Headlines
This project involves building a simple web scraper using Python to extract top news headlines from a website. The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the target news page and `BeautifulSoup` to parse and navigate the HTML structure. By identifying headline tags such as `<h2>`, `<h3>`, or `<title>`, the scraper collects relevant text content that represents news headlines. These headlines are then cleaned and stored in a list. Finally, the script writes the extracted headlines into a `.txt` file, each numbered for clarity. This approach provides a lightweight and efficient way to gather current news without relying on APIs. It’s a great exercise in web scraping fundamentals, HTML parsing, and file handling in Python. The project can be extended to include multiple pages, filter by categories, or even schedule periodic scraping. It also introduces basic error handling and encourages inspecting HTML structures to target specific elements. Overall, it’s a practical tool for automating news collection and understanding web data extraction.
